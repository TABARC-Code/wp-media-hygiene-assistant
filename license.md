GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 2025 TABARC-Code

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software. This General Public
License applies to the software made available under it.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software, receive the source code or
obtain it if you want, change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
rights or asking you to surrender them. Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you
modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, you must give
the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they too
receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so
they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps:
  1. copyright the software
  2. offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
     distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands there is no warranty for this free software.

THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
